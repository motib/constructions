Geometric constructions are fundamental to Euclidean geometry and appear in secondary-school textbooks. Most students of mathematics will also know the three problems posed by the Greeks---trisecting angle, squaring a circle and doubling a cube---for which a construction is impossible. There are many interesting and surprising geometrical constructions that are probably unknown to almost all students and teachers. This document presents these constructions in great detail using only secondary-school mathematics.

Contents:

* The collapsing compass: Euclid proved that any construction that can be done using a fixed compass can done using a collapsing compass.

* Trisecting an angle: Trisecting an angle can be done using instruments somewhat more complex that the straightedge and compass.

* Squaring a circle: Adam Kochansy and Ramanujan gave constructions with straightedge and compass for lengths that are very good approximations to \pi.

* Construction with only a compass: Lorenzo Mascheroni and Georg Mohr showed that any construction that can be done with straightedge and compass can done with only a compass.

* Construction with only a straightedge: Jacob Steiner showed that any construction that can be done with straightedge and compass can done with only a straightedge provided that a single circle already exists somewhere in the plane.

* The axioms of origami: Origami, the art of paper folding, can be formalized in mathematics by seven axioms. These axioms related folds to mathematical formulas that can be used for geometric constructions.

* Trisecting an angle: Angles can be trisected using origami.

* Doubling a cube: A cube can be doubled with origami.

* Roots of polynomials: Eduard Lill discovered a graphical method of finding real roots of polynomials (actually, verifying that a given value is a root of a given polynomial).

* Computing roots of polynomials using origami: Margharita P. Beloch's showed that one origami fold can implement Lill's method for finding roots of cubic polynomials.
