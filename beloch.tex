\chapter{Beloch's Fold and Beloch's Square}\label{c.beloch}

\section{The Beloch fold}\label{s.beloch-fold}

Margharita P. Beloch discovered a remarkable connection between origami and Lill's method for finding roots of polynomials \cite{hull-beloch}. She found that one application of the operation of origami Axiom~6 (Section~\ref{s.ax6}) applied to the first path of Lill's method can obtain a real root of any cubic polynomial. The operation is often called the \emph{Beloch fold}.

Consider the polynomial $p(x)=x^3+6x^2+11x+6$ (Section~\ref{s.magic}). In the following diagram we have emphasized the second path and renamed some vertices. To solve the equation we perform a Beloch fold to simultaneously place the points $P',Q'$ on the line segments of lengths $a_2,a_1$, respectively. Unfortunately, if you perform the fold, the path does not solve the equation: $Q'$ is way off to the right, so the angles at $P'$ and $Q'$ are not right angles.

Recall that a fold is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment between any point and its reflection around the fold. We want $\overline{P'Q'}$ to be a fold so that it will be perpendicular to both $\overline{QQ'}$ and $\overline{PP'}$. If $\overline{P'Q'}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{QQ'}$ and $\overline{PP'}$, then $P',Q'$, the reflections of $P,Q$, must be the same distance away from the fold as $P$ and $Q$, respectively. With some change of notation we have the following diagram.

A line $a_2'$ is drawn so that it is parallel to $a_2$ and the same distance from $a_2$ as $a_2$ is from $P$. Similarly, line $a_1'$ is drawn so that it is parallel to $a_1$ and the same distance from $a_1$ as $a_1$ is from $Q$. Apply Axiom~6 to simultaneously place $P$ at $P'$ on $a_2'$ and to place $Q$ at $Q'$ on $a_1'$. The fold $\overline{RS}$ is the perpendicular bisector of the lines $\overline{PP'}$ and $\overline{QQ'}$; therefore, the angles at $R$ and $S$ are right angles as required.

\newpage

Let us try the Beloch fold on the polynomial $x^3-3x^2-3x+1$ from Section~\ref{s.negative}. $a_2$ is the vertical line segment of length $3$ whose equation is $x=1$, and its parallel line is $a_2'$ whose equation is $x=2$, because $P$ is at a distance of $1$ from $a_2$. $a_1$ is the horizontal line segment of length $3$ whose equation is $y=-3$, and its parallel line is $a_1'$ whose equation is $y=-2$ because $Q$ is at a distance of $1$ from $a_1$. The fold $RS$ is the perpendicular bisector of both $\overline{PP'}$ and $\overline{QQ'}$. The line $\overline{PRSQ}$ is the same as the second path in Section~\ref{s.negative}.

\section{The Beloch square}\label{s.beloch-square}

This construction in the previous section can be expressed in terms of a \emph{Beloch square}: Given two points $P,Q$ and two lines $a_2,a_1$, construct a square $\overline{ARSB}$, such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item One side is $\overline{RS}$ where $R$ lies on $a_2$ and $S$ lies on $a_1$;
\item $P$ lies on $\overline{RA}$ and $Q$ lies on $\overline{SB}$.
\end{itemize}
The following diagram extends the construction for $x^3+6x^2+11x+6$ to show the Beloch square. The length of $RS$ is $\sqrt{80}=4\sqrt{5}\approx 8.94$. We can construct the square by adding three sides of this length.
